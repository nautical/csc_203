<h3 id="slide-2-what-is-a-bitcoin-transaction-simple-explanation">Slide 2: What is a Bitcoin Transaction? (Simple Explanation)</h3>
<p>Sending and Receiving Bitcoin</p>
<pre><code>-   A Bitcoin transaction is like a digital record of sending Bitcoin from one person to another.
    
-   It's how Bitcoin "moves" between people's digital wallets.
    
-   Think of it like writing down in a public notebook who sent how much Bitcoin to whom.
    
-   This "notebook" is called the blockchain.
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Analogy:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Imagine you’re giving a friend some digital money. A Bitcoin transaction is like writing down that you gave them the money in a book that everyone can see.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="slide-3-bitcoin-addresses-your-digital-mailbox">Slide 3: Bitcoin Addresses: Your Digital Mailbox</h3>
<p>Where Bitcoin Lives: Bitcoin Addresses</p>
<pre><code>-   A Bitcoin address is like a bank account number, but for Bitcoin.
    
-   It's a unique string of letters and numbers where you can receive Bitcoin.
    
-   People send Bitcoin _to_ your Bitcoin address.
    
-   You can have many Bitcoin addresses.
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Analogy:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Think of a Bitcoin address as your email address. People send you emails (Bitcoin) to that address.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://static.learnmeabitcoin.com/diagrams/png/transaction.png" alt="Diagram of the structure of a bitcoin transaction showing the inputs and outputs."><br>
To be more precise, a transaction:</p>
<ol>
<li>Selects existing batches of bitcoins (<a href="https://learnmeabitcoin.com/technical/transaction/input/">inputs</a>) and unlocks them.</li>
<li>Creates new batches of bitcoins (<a href="https://learnmeabitcoin.com/technical/transaction/output/">outputs</a>) and puts new locks on them.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can have multiple inputs and outputs in a single transaction.</p>
<p>So you can think of a transaction as being <strong>part of a chain</strong> of outputs; one transaction creates an output, and then a future transaction selects that output (as an input) and unlocks it to create new outputs.</p>
<h3 id="slide-4-transaction-inputs-where-the-bitcoin-comes-from-detailed">Slide 4: Transaction Inputs: Where the Bitcoin Comes From (Detailed)</h3>
<p>Inputs: Tracing the Bitcoin’s History</p>
<pre><code>-   When you send Bitcoin, you're actually spending Bitcoin you received in previous transactions.
    
-   These previous receipts are called "Unspent Transaction Outputs" or UTXOs.
    
-   Each input in a new transaction points to a specific UTXO.
    
-   It's like saying, "I'm using the Bitcoin I got from this earlier transaction to pay for this."
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Analogy:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Imagine you have a bunch of gift cards of different values. When you buy something, you use one or more of those gift cards. The gift cards are like UTXOs.<br>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="slide-5-transaction-outputs-where-the-bitcoin-goes-detailed">Slide 5: Transaction Outputs: Where the Bitcoin Goes (Detailed)</h3>
<p>Outputs: Sending Bitcoin to New Addresses</p>
<pre><code>-   Outputs specify where the Bitcoin is going in the current transaction.
    
-   Each output includes a Bitcoin address and the amount of Bitcoin being sent to that address.
    
-   A transaction can have multiple outputs (sending Bitcoin to multiple people at once).
    
-   Outputs create new UTXOs that can be spent in future transactions.
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Analogy:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>When you use those gift cards, you might not use the exact amount. You get change back. The change is like a new UTXO.<br>
<img src="https://static.learnmeabitcoin.com/diagrams/png/transaction-fee.png" alt="Diagram showing how a transaction fee is the remainder of the value of a transaction's inputs minus the value of it's outputs."></li>

<h3 id="slide-6-transaction-fees-paying-for-the-service">Slide 6: Transaction Fees: Paying for the Service</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Transaction Fees: Rewarding the Network</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>When you send Bitcoin, you include a small fee.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This fee is paid to the people who process transactions (miners).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fees incentivize miners to include your transaction in a block.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Transactions with higher fees are usually processed faster.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Analogy:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Think of it like tipping a waiter. A bigger tip might get you better service.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="slide-7-the-technical-structure-of-a-transaction-simplified">Slide 7: The Technical Structure of a Transaction (Simplified)</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>How a Transaction is Built (Simplified)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A Bitcoin transaction is made up of different pieces of information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These pieces include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Version:</strong> Tells the Bitcoin network which rules to follow.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Inputs:</strong> Where the Bitcoin is coming from (UTXOs).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Outputs:</strong> Where the Bitcoin is going.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Locktime:</strong> A special setting (usually not used) that can delay when a transaction can be processed.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="slide-8-unspent-transaction-outputs-utxos-explained-again">Slide 8: Unspent Transaction Outputs (UTXOs) Explained Again</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>UTXOs: The Building Blocks of Bitcoin</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Let’s talk about UTXOs again because they’re important!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>UTXOs are like individual “coins” that you own.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your Bitcoin balance is the sum of all your UTXOs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When you spend Bitcoin, you’re combining and spending your UTXOs to create new UTXOs for the recipient and yourself (change).</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Analogy:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Imagine you have a wallet with different denominations of cash ($1, $5, $10 bills). UTXOs are like those individual bills. Your total cash is your balance.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="slide-9-how-transactions-get-on-the-blockchain-simplified">Slide 9: How Transactions Get on the Blockchain (Simplified)</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>From Your Wallet to the Blockchain</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You use your Bitcoin wallet to create and sign a transaction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your wallet sends this transaction to the Bitcoin network.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nodes (computers on the network) check if the transaction is valid.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Valid transactions are added to a waiting list called the “mempool.”</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="slide-10-mining-and-confirmations-making-it-official">Slide 10: Mining and Confirmations: Making it Official</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Mining: Adding Transactions to the Blockchain</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Miners are like the record-keepers of the Bitcoin network.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They take transactions from the mempool and group them into “blocks.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Miners solve a complex puzzle to add a block to the blockchain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This process is called “mining.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When a block is added, the transactions in it are considered “confirmed.”</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Analogy:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Imagine the miners are like librarians who collect all the notes (transactions) and bind them into a book (block).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="slide-11-confirmations-and-security-why-its-hard-to-cheat">Slide 11: Confirmations and Security: Why It’s Hard to Cheat</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Confirmations: Making Transactions Secure</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Each new block added to the blockchain is like a “stamp of approval” for the transactions in it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>More confirmations mean it’s harder to change or reverse a transaction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Six confirmations are generally considered very secure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The blockchain is designed to be very difficult to tamper with.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Analogy:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Imagine each book (block) is added to a library shelf (blockchain). The more books are on top of a specific book, the harder it is to take that book out and change it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
